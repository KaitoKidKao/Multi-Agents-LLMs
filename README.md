# Simulating Conversations Between Two AI Agents

## ðŸ§  Introduction

This project simulates a conversation between **two AI agents** that can exchange, respond, and collaborate to perform a programming task. Users can interact through a **visual interface** built using **Gradio**.

The final output is the code generated by the agents along with its **execution result**.

## ðŸ—‚ Project Structure


### ðŸ“„ File Descriptions

- **`agent.py`**  
  Initializes agents with contextual response capabilities. Each agent can play a different role in the conversation.

- **`utils.py`**  
  Defines a helper class for **threading**, ensuring the conversation runs smoothly without interruption.

- **`chat.py`**  
  Constructs the chatbox allowing two agents to interact with each other. After the conversation, the program **extracts the generated code** and its **execution result**.

- **`app.py`**  
  Builds a **visual interface** using **Gradio**, enabling users to follow the conversation and view the final output produced by the agents.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
This is an experimental project and can be extended by integrating advanced language models (LLMs).

Useful for learning, demonstrating the concept of AI agent collaboration, or building interactive AI applications.
